#  Cybersecurity Attack Detection Lab Report

## üß† Project Summary

This project simulates multiple cyberattacks from Kali Linux on a vulnerable Metasploitable 2 machine and monitors them using Splunk SIEM (installed on Windows). Custom dashboards and alerts were created to detect and respond to these attacks, simulating a basic SOC environment.
